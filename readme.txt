My blog is divided into 3 main pages, the first one is the home page,the other two with
the same layout are Academics.html and Journey.html.

Home.html applies a responsive layout and the photo wall is capable of animated effects.

Academics.html and Journey.html both apply the boostrap framework and use a grid system for layout.

Both pages can play background music and use js to implement message board effects.

It is worth mentioning that Journey.html displays images in a rotating manner.
